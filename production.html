            <li>
              <strong>Our colour scheme</strong>
				<br><p>We specifically picked the following vibrant colors to bring Cliché Craze Games to life, as the combination of these colors makes a perfect blend of playfullness, joy and humor that alligns with our brand's image. The colors bring up positive emotions and add to the fun experience of the players of our games. From the energetic bursts of red to the positive yellows, to the trust and sympathy that the blues and pinks give, each color serves a purpose to make the player enjoy a humorous game in a safe space.</p>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices</strong>
			  <br><p>To add to the joyful feeling that the colors scheme of Cliché Craze Games presents, we decided upon a header font that gives off this same feeling. Next to that, we picked two clear fonts to present the subheaders and bodies. This will make sure that the information is directly communicated and easy to read.</p>

            <li><strong>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</strong>
			  <br><p>To present the information on the webiste of Cliché Craze Games clearly, we made use of several UI patterns.</p>  
			<ul>
			<li>Menu Organization <i>The website’s menu organization is simple and easy to navigate: giving users quick access to purchase our product, share their own fun experiences with our product, and more options for corporate, the shop, and the developers in the top right corner of the website.</i></li>
            <li>Buttons <i> With the use of buttons, website visitors can easily navigate through our webiste and find relevant pages quickly.</i></li>
			<li>Cards <i> On some pages you can see cards being used in order to ground the information being stated.</i></li>
			<li>Carousel <i> A carousel is used on this website to showcase several options to the viewer in a clean and easy-for-the-eye way. Viewers can navigate through the carousel and find the useful information on the slides together with corelating visuals.</i></li>
              </ul>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>To see if our website is working properly, we set up a testing round. Here we wanted to focus on a few essentials. It was most important to know if the users could easily manage through our webiste and find what they are looking for. This is depended on the set up and UI patterns used and the information which is directly available to them. Secondly, we wanted to make sure that there were no errors or bugs that made the experience less enjoyable and if the users had ay suggestions in general. Finally, we liked to know if the visuals and UI patterns used on the website had the results we were looking for, do they add to the feeling of Cliché Craze Games?</li>
            <li>This testing round was made out of a total of 5 participants who were picked out as they matched the target audience of Cliché Craze Games, meaning that they are student expats aged between 18 and 25 and have been living in the Netherlands long enough to have experienced the difficulty of making friends. In order for them to test our website, we used a laptop view set up during all sessions, which were all conducted in-person on the campus of Breda University of Applied Sciences. During these sessions the participants were given a handfull of tasks, each a bit different from each other in order to cover all aspects of the webiste. They were asked to voice their process and opinions out loud in order for us to see any difficulties and have a true experience. Finally, this all was recorded from a distance to see their movement through the website.</li>
            <li> We found that users easily completed the tasks we gave them and managed to navigate through the website quickly. The use of our UI patterns made it clear for them to do this. Next to that, the users were very positive about the visuals created for the website as they believed they completely fit the theme of Cliché Craze Games. However, there are still a lot of bugs in the codes of the website. Starting with the fact that not all pages are 100% responsive when being minimalised, which is also the fact of the navigation bar at the top. The background of the home page deforms when asks to be responsive and the text on the page and on the carousel isn't clearly visible anymore due to the light color which sometimes blends too with the background. This results in text being missed when looking at the page in a minimalised form. Also, the buttons glitch when being hoovered over, giving off an unprofessional view as this also moves all of the text around it. Finally, the boxes are misshaped when being minimalised, which disturbs the clean look they act for. </li>
			<li> This means that before being able to officially launch this website, there needs to be a focus on fixing all of the bugs stated above and doing several more text rounds in order to see if the usability is more professional. The functionality of some aspects should also be reviewed and improved to be final, like the connection between the shop and the cart. </li>
          </ul>
