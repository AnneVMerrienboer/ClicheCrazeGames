          <p>Please write about&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One of the assignments for this project was to create a working website that relates to our brand with the use of our visual identity. The website is filled with colorful illustrations and texts that include our brand colors and funky typography. These participants were all a part of our initial target audience, self initiated student expats, we gave them various tasks to complete to see if they would be able to use the website smoothly.</li>
            <li>We had five individuals from our target audience navigate our website and complete necessary tasks that our customers would need to use. We had our individuals test our site on computers next to us. These tests were completed on University grounds. With computers set up in front of our testers, we gave them a series of tasks to complete such as navigating to our developers pages along with purchasing one of our products. These tests were simply recorded on our personal cell phones and they were recorded as next to our testers as they were completing their tasks.</li>
            <li>We can conclude that these participants had no trouble completing the tasks and found it to be a fun experience. They all complimented the visuals of the website. It was very simple and could be made more extensive, but thought it was perfect for a first trial as it is usable.
