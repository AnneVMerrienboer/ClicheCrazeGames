            <li>
              <strong>Our colour scheme</strong>
				<br><p>We specifically picked the following vibrant colors to bring Cliché Craze Games to life, as the combination of these colors makes a perfect blend of playfullness, joy and humor that alligns with our brand's image. The colors bring up positive emotions and add to the fun experience of the players of our games. From the energetic bursts of red to the positive yellows, to the trust and sympathy that the blues and pinks give, each color serves a purpose to make the player enjoy a humorous game in a safe space.</p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EF3D23;"></span>
                  #EF3D23 <i>The red color stands for energy and acts as an attention grabber.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #244FA2;"></span>
                  #244FA2 <i>Blue is a color that evokes a secure and supportive feeling.</i>
                </li>
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F9B617;"></span>
                  #F9B617 <i>Yellow signifies happiness, joy and positivity, it also adds to the energy of red.</i>
                </li> 
				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #2DBBAA;"></span>
                  #2DBBAA <i>As turquoise is a hue of blue, this color also evokes the same feelings.</i>

				<li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F3EEEA;"></span>
                  #F3EEEA <i>The off-white acts as a ground color to simplify, it can also evoke openness.</i>
                </li>

                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F7B2CD;"></span>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices</strong>
			  <br><p>To add to the joyful feeling that the colors scheme of Cliché Craze Games presents, we decided upon a header font that gives off this same feeling. Next to that, we picked two clear fonts to present the subheaders and bodies. This will make sure that the information is directly communicated and easy to read.</p>

            <li><strong>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</strong>
			  <br><p>To present the information on the webiste of Cliché Craze Games clearly, we made use of several UI patterns.</p>  
			<ul>
			<li>Menu Organization <i>The website’s menu organization is simple and easy to navigate: giving users quick access to purchase our product, share their own fun experiences with our product, and more options for corporate, the shop, and the developers in the top right corner of the website.</i></li>
            <li>Buttons <i> With the use of buttons, website visitors can easily navigate through our webiste and find relevant pages quickly.</i></li>
			<li>Cards <i> On some pages you can see cards being used in order to ground the information being stated.</i></li>
			<li>Carousel <i> A carousel is used on this website to showcase several options to the viewer in a clean and easy-for-the-eye way. Viewers can navigate through the carousel and find the useful information on the slides together with corelating visuals.</i></li>
              </ul>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>One of the assignments for this project was to create a working website that relates to our brand with the use of our visual identity. The website is filled with colorful illustrations and texts that include our brand colors and funky typography. These participants were all a part of our initial target audience, self initiated student expats, we gave them various tasks to complete to see if they would be able to use the website smoothly.</li>
            <li>We had five individuals from our target audience navigate our website and complete necessary tasks that our customers would need to use. We had our individuals test our site on computers next to us. These tests were completed on University grounds. With computers set up in front of our testers, we gave them a series of tasks to complete such as navigating to our developers pages along with purchasing one of our products. These tests were simply recorded on our personal cell phones and they were recorded as next to our testers as they were completing their tasks.</li>
            <li>We can conclude that these participants had no trouble completing the tasks and found it to be a fun experience. They all complimented the visuals of the website. It was very simple and could be made more extensive, but thought it was perfect for a first trial as it is usable.
