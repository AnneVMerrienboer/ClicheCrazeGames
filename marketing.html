          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication  Media Plan.</p>
          <p>Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication  Media Plan.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p><strong>Posts</strong></p>
		<p>In general, our posts did not perform as expected. The one post that reached the most people was the one which got boosted. In general, the posts got between 3 and 10 likes, with the boosted post receiving the most likes, however we did not receive comments on our posts. With the post we boosted we reached over 950 people. The only downside of this is that we cannot see if these people are part of the target group. Out of the 1110 accounts with all our posts, only 10% resulted in profile visits. We tried different times of posting, in the morning, afternoon or evening. Looking at the statistics, it appears that the morning leads to a higher amount of people reached.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Stories</strong></p>
		<p>The stories did not perform as expected either. These were varied between interactive and non-interactive stories, either notifying people of when or what something is happening or allowing people to send messages to us or visit our website. According to the statistics, our posts reached more people than our stories, though our stories had more interactions.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Overall</strong></p> 
		<p>We believe that we needed to boost our posts more. Most of the posts did not reach as many people since they only went out to followers instead of people who don’t follow us. However, we think that we should not change the content of our posts as much, since these gave us a positive reaction from the people we showed them to. Another point is that we think we needed to post more often. We posted every 2 to 3 days to not overload the system. We believe this might have hindered us in our social media presence since we have not posted as often. Looking at the objectives, we should have focused more on reaching them. Though we did reach 1110 accounts, we cannot see if 200 of them were student accounts. We could have made use of reels to reach more people.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Looking back at the campaign, we posted according to schedule with posts that align with our brand, we do think we could’ve created more interaction and reachability with the audience, by making use of interactive stories and reels, or add more incentives.</p>
          <p>Our new objective will be to create more excitement and build a community that revolves around humor and connection between people.</p>
          <p><strong>The content calender for the future includes:</strong>
				<br><strong>1. Meet the team:</strong> Show more about the team behind the brand and product. By attaching people to the brand can make it more relatable for others.
				<br><strong>2. Highlight more about the product: </strong>Show videos of people playing, have people share their opinions about our product.
				<br><strong>3. Content generated by the user:</strong> Have people share their experience, any amusing moments that happened, or reposting posts/stories/memes that our communities share on their social media.
				<br><strong>4. Giveaways: </strong>This way we can reward loyal customers. We can make the giveaway more interactive by adding a quiz to it or have them fill out a survey through which they can enter the giveaway.
				<br><strong>5. Adapt the content based on the season: </strong>We can make use of our brands values to make content based on the season or special holidays that are happening around the world. For example, our brand revolves around stereotypes, so we can make a stereotypical card about Christmas. This can also apply for holidays not traditionally celebrated in other countries or cultures.
			    <br><strong>6. Partnerships with (book)shops or influencers:</strong> By offering our game to bookstores or influencers who align with our brand it helps us reach our goals of connecting people from anywhere in the world. Because of their large audience we can reach more people.</p>
