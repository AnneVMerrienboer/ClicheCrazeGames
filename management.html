          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
			<h6>We found that our target audience mainly faces the following problems</h6>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>New environment:</strong> Even though these students made the choice to move to a completely new environment, this does not make the process easier. They were still in a completely new world and didn't know what to do.</li>
			<li><strong>Social anxiety:</strong> Some students were coping with social anxiety, this did not help them in their journey of meeting new people. They had no idea what to talk about with people and what to bond over. Making it hard for them to start conversations.</li>
			<li><strong>No familiar people:</strong> While the resason of a number of students decided to study in another country was to be more independent, the first few weeks they depended very heavily on the contact they had with the people back home. This was because they did not know anyone in the place they had moved to.</li>
          </ul>
			 <h6>Describe briefly how the problems are solved now (existing alternatives).</h6>
		  <ul>
            <li><strong>School events:</strong> Schools organise several events, such as international day and introweek, where people can meet eachother and find possible new friends who went through the same process.</li>
			<li><strong>Connection with friends and family at home:</strong> Like mentioned before, many students have extensive contact with familiar people from back home whoch helps them go through this lonely and hard time.</li>
			<li><strong>Various card games:</strong> There are many card games on the market, also some very popular ones for this specific target audience. Think Cards Against Humanity and Uno.</li>
          </ul>
			  
         
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In order to create a fun experience for our target audience, we will create a card game they can use to break the ice. This card came will be available both on- and offline. As we believe humor is the perfect way to break the ice, the cards display various stereotypes that the players can spend their night guessing and getting to know about. And of course, it can be turned into a drinking game.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List your target customers and/or users.</li>
            <li>Describe briefly the characteristics of your ideal customer (early adopter, brand persona).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A card game with a hilarious twist.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>On- and offline editions:</strong> We will release this card game both on- and offline, this way our users can choose whatever their own preference is. The online version is more portable, while the offline version is traditional.</li>
			<li><strong>Expansion packs:</strong> Our card game is not done with just one version, in order to keep the game updated we will release more expansion packs as time goes on. It will never get boring.</li>
			<li><strong>Easy access to target audience:</strong> Being students ourselves, we have a very easy access to our target audience, this way we keep being up to date about their needs and can spread the game more easily.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
