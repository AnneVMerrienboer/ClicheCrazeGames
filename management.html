          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
			<h6>We found that our target audience mainly faces the following problems.</h6>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>New environment:</strong> Even though these students made the choice to move to a completely new environment, this does not make the process easier. They were still in a completely new world and didn't know what to do.</li>
			<li><strong>Social anxiety:</strong> Some students were coping with social anxiety, this did not help them in their journey of meeting new people. They had no idea what to talk about with people and what to bond over. Making it hard for them to start conversations.</li>
			<li><strong>No familiar people:</strong> While the resason of a number of students decided to study in another country was to be more independent, the first few weeks they depended very heavily on the contact they had with the people back home. This was because they did not know anyone in the place they had moved to.</li>
          </ul>
			 <h6>These students used the following solutions that already exist..</h6>
		  <ul>
            <li><strong>School events:</strong> Schools organise several events, such as international day and introweek, where people can meet eachother and find possible new friends who went through the same process.</li>
			<li><strong>Connection with friends and family at home:</strong> Like mentioned before, many students have extensive contact with familiar people from back home whoch helps them go through this lonely and hard time.</li>
			<li><strong>Various card games:</strong> There are many card games on the market, also some very popular ones for this specific target audience. Think Cards Against Humanity and Uno.</li>
          </ul>
			  
         
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In order to create a fun experience for our target audience, we will create a card game they can use to break the ice. This card came will be available both on- and offline. As we believe humor is the perfect way to break the ice, the cards display various stereotypes that the players can spend their night guessing and getting to know about. And of course, it can be turned into a drinking game.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Psychographic:</strong> Our target audience has a low social status. However, they are very dedicated to their school and work in order to change this. As they moved this far from home they are very open-minded, social and adaptable. This helped them find a better eduation and proof their independance. Their day-to-day life is filled with school, work, social events with friends and exporing. This all while they keep a close eye on their expenses which is mainly put into  Physical, safety, secturity and social needs</li>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>We started this process with a focus on wanting to provide expats the service of helping them with their moving document etc. However, after the problem interviews we noticed that loneliness was the main problem students faced. This was because they already got help with their arrangements from either another organisation or school. They really needed something that could help break the ice with others in order to make new friends. They mentioned that existing events such as the intro week really helped them as you do teambuilding activities here and get to know each other on a personal level, before diving into the school work. Together with the fact that they mentioned liking to go out with friends and humor being the ultimate icebreaker for them, we came up with the idea of Cliché Craze Games. A fun card game that makes use of stereotypes that friends can play before or instead of going out. As card games such as Cards Against Humanity and Joking Hazard, which are also based on dark humor, are very populair among this generation, we believe that this concept acts as a perfect solution for the problem of our target audience.
		 <br>Due to the fact that we have changed our concept a bit we have slight differences each lean canvas model. With the help of the problem and solution interviews as well as research for other classes such as content, we have come to the final lean canvas which aligns with the needs and preferences of our target audience.</p>
